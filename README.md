# Swag Account is a project to help me learn C++


From doing this project I learned:
* Class inheritance
    * Class operations (constructing, destructing)
* Polymorphism
* Virtual methods & overriding (early & late binding)
* Memory management
    * smart pointers
    * garbage collection
* Header file structure & header guards
* Pass by constant reference for data I don't want to copy over
* Pitchfork project structure
* CMake setup and compiling with Clang & C++17
* Debugging with lldb

## Future work
- Add libraries to this project
- Add more types of accounts and simulate a bank account over X period of time based on historical market data & consumer spending.
